# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
The Work Day Scheduler showcases my skills with using Bootstrap and Jquery. I have learned an introduction in how we can use bootstrap to easier create a layout and add classes more effectivly than writing it from scratch.

I learned how you can set up a timer in different formats, save information and retrieve information from local storage and change the view of a page based on the time of day.
